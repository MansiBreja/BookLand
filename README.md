A library requires to store,update and delete huge chunks of data almost everyday. Hence it requires a proper organization of information so that it can be easily retrieved, updated, inserted or deleted.

Here, in this project, we have aimed at depicting the various aspects involved while creating a library's database and developed the front end using JDBC.
